👋 Hi! This is Meilisearch, an open-source, easy-to-use, blazingly fast, and hyper-relevant search engine built in Rust.

Meilisearch is a young company based in Paris. From the outset, our goal is a simple and intuitive experience for both developers and end-users. To know more about us, you can read our [blog](https://blog.meilisearch.com/).

## 🔎 Meilisearch

Our main repository is [Meilisearch](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch). The code in this repository is only concerned with exposing the HTTP API, managing multiple indexes, and handling the update store.

Search and indexation are the domain of our core engine, [milli](https://github.com/meilisearch/milli/), while our [tokenizer library](https://github.com/meilisearch/Tokenizer) handles tokenization.

You can learn more about Meilisearch and its features in our [documentation](https://docs.meilisearch.com).

## 🔗 Integrations

Our team and community have worked hard to bring Meilisearch to almost all popular web development languages, frameworks, and deployment options. New integrations are constantly in development. Check the complete list in [the integration guides](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides).

## 📚 Documentation

Our [documentation website](https://docs.meilisearch.com) is hosted in a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation).

## 🤝 Contributing

Hey! We're glad you're thinking about contributing to Meilisearch! Feel free to pick an [issue labeled as `good first issue`](https://github.com/meilisearch/landing/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), and to ask any question you need. Some points might not be clear and we are available to help you!

Also, we recommend following the [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to create your PR.

## 💡 Product: feedback & suggestions

See what's next on our [public roadmap](https://roadmap.meilisearch.com/), where you can submit your ideas and vote for the features you want.

You can also go to our [Product repository](https://github.com/meilisearch/product) and open a discussion about a feature and give your feedback. Feel free to participate in the current discussions. We are looking forward to reading your comments.

Any suggestion or feedback is highly appreciated. Thank you so much for your support!

## 🥰 Community & Developer Relations

If you want to know more about how we handle Developer Relations at MeiliSearch: our processes, activities, and plans, you can check our [devrel repo](https://github.com/meilisearch/devrel).

We invite you to join our [Meilisearch Community Slack](https://slack.meilisearch.com/), where you can find support from our team and the community, but where you can also share your projects or just talk about random stuff with other members of the Meilisearch community 😁

## 🖥 Demos

Do you want to see Meilisearch in action? Check the list of our demos [in the dedicated repository](https://github.com/meilisearch/demos).

## 💌 Contact

### Forum 📋

Our preferred method of communication is our forums on GitHub Discussions. Asynchronous long-form discussion communication with minimal repetition.

Your project announcements, support queries, and sweet, sweet praise all belong in the [Meilisearch forum](<(https://github.com/meilisearch/Meilisearch/discussions)>).

For feature proposals, you can go to the [Product forum](https://github.com/meilisearch/product/discussions).

### Chat 💬

Prefer the speed and fluidity of chat? Then join our [Slack community](https://slack.meilisearch.com/).

We think chat and forum discussions are [highly complementary](https://blog.discourse.org/2018/04/effectively-using-discourse-together-with-group-chat/), happily co-existing as two different modes of conversation. Try to use the right tool for the job, but most importantly, we just want to hear from you, regardless of the medium!

### GitHub issues 🔩

Bugs should be reported as issues in the corresponding repository, e.g., [meilisearch/Meilisearch](https://github.com/meilisearch/Meilisearch/issues), [meilisearch/documentation](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation/issues), and so forth.

## We are hiring! 🌍
